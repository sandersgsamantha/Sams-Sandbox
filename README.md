# BOEM_FPS_FW
Code both SIBER and modeling for mapping fish food webs along Frying Pan Shoals (FPS), North Carolina.

# Who?
This code has been created and adjusted based on previous models such as SIBER to fit the data for S. Sanders M.S. Thesis.

# Where and Why?
FPS= Frying Pan Shoals, NC is a 30 mile sand shoal environment noted as an essential fish habitat by the National Marine Fisheries Service. The shoal itself like many other sand shoals and offshore resources is managed and regulated by the Beuru of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) who plans to use FPS for future beach renourishment projects along the coast of NC. Before altering and dredging the habitat BOEM through UNCW is preforming multiple ecological assesments to help characterize the shoal and the organisms that use it to determine best dreding practices and monitoring plans.

# Food Webs
One way to characterize the environment and how organisms may use it's resources is through food web assesments. This can be done through the use of stable isotopes paired with other analysis such as gut content analysis or previous literature giving insight into the diets of fish species. In the code currently we plan to use a combination of d13C and d15N to characterize the isotopic niche of the most abundant species caugh over 2 years of trawling along the shoal. The goal is to determine if these isotopic niches change seasonally, spatially, or if they are influenced by other environmental parameters. We also plan to determine if there are significant differences between species niche across space and time determining what trophic level they occupy (d15N) and if there is a difference in basal energy resource (d13C).

# SIBER and GLM
SIBER will be used to map out species isotopic niches while GLM will be used to dertime significant differences in spatial and environmental affects.
